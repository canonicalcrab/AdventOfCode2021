# AdventOfCode2021

This repo is organized into days and puzzles, for example the second puzzle of
the third day will be located at day3/2.forth and the input for the puzzle will
be located at day3/2input, or if the input is shared with the first puzzle, as
day3/1input.

All solutions will read from stdin and can be invoked with:
 `cat xinput | gforth x.forth`
